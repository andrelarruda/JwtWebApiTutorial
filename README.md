Simple login process using ASP .NET Core Web API and .NET Core 6

# What does this API do?
This is a demo API to demonstrate the use of JWT Web Tokens in Authorization process.
It fakes an Authentication saving user data in memory.

# Source
This code was built following a tutorial on Youtube by Patrick God (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7q3pEK1EA0)

# Future goals
My goal is to build my own API applying the concepts of authentication and authorization seen here.
